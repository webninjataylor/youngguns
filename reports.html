              <p>With it being way early in the season for the fall Striper run we knew it would be difficult to find a quality fish in the area but also weren't willing to make the 100 plus mile run north with no solid reports (Thanks Joe), so we decided to work some of the local haunts to see if we could pull a large resident bass.</p>
              <p>We started out Saturday morning dragging the hardware around the Shrewsburry Rocks (those are bunker spoons for you boys down south) but nothing but bluefish so we decided to run up the Hudson to see of we could pull a dirty river slob.</p>
              <p>We tried by the Veranzano Bridge and over by the Salts fishing structure, no bass with the occasional blue fish. We had reports of bait in the harbor behind the Statue of Liberty but no luck when we got there so we finished the day drifting live bait over some numbers we had and made the run home hoping to pass a school of bunker on the way but never did--skunked on the first day. Several boats made the long run but only 2 or 3 had fish to show for it Including our Contender teammate, Joe Vezzosi who weighed in&nbsp; a 26 pounder to take first place on the board for day one.</p>
              <p>Day two, we took a chance on running up the Shrewsburry River to fish live baits and storm shads over some holes--again, nothing but bluefish but during the run to plan B, we noticed guys anchored up at the bridge, clamming, pulling in bass.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, we didn't have one clam on the boat so we tried it with live bait but that wasn't on the menu that morning so we ran back up the Hudson to drift over the same numbers we had and the patience paid off with a 39" bass taken on eel. He was long but skinny and only weighed 17.4 pounds but not bad considering we were the only boat to weigh in a fish on day two.</p>
              <p>Congratulations to Joe who remained in first and took home the new 21 Contender--Great Job!!! </p>

              <p>Monday morning, with bad weather forecasted, we decided to poke our noses out to see if we could handle it. The ride out wasn't too bad and we were able make it to the Wilmington with time to spare. We were able to fish for a couple of hours in rough water before a huge squall engulfed the boat with 40 mph winds and torrential downpours. Unfortunately we had to pull the lines and fight the weather for up to two hours before we were able to break through it. We were headed towards home but still had some time to fish, and that we did, with only one knockdown and no fish--the important part is that we made it home safely and the contender handled it like a champ.</p>
              <p>Day two we took a lay after getting beat up on Monday but not knocked out--turned out we missed the best weather fishing day thanks to the sub-par reports from NOAA.</p>
              <p>Day three, well rested, we headed to the deep of the Baltimore with the Big Boys. We were in a fleet of about twenty boats all working some good water out past the 1000 line. We saw boats hooking up around us and decided to fish the area hard, but to no avail, skunked again.</p>
              <p>After taking another lay on Thursday, we put it all on the line for Friday knowing it would only take one good fish to change our luck. We headed our towards the Spencer and fished between the 100 line and the 1000 line. With some Big Whites on the board and only one qualifying Blue-Marlin, we decided to drag the biggest stuff we had. Early on in the morning, we had the super-chugger on the long-line tied to the 80 set with tight drag and something (Blue Marlin) peeled off about 10 yards of line but didn't get the hook. We knew whatever would hit that thing (the size of a small baby) had to be Big so we worked the area hard.</p>
              <p>We were able to raise one more Blue that charged across our spread but didn't bite a thing and that would be all the action we would see for the day and the week. Down but not out!</p>

Around 8:00 AM we stopped 2 nm short to prepare for lines in the water at 8:30 AM.&nbsp; We hooked up on our first fish within 30 minutes and boated a 40lb tuna on the flats of the Lindy.&nbsp; We had good water and decided to work the area hard and went 1 for 2 on Mahi around 12-15lbs and caught two more Tuna with the largest at 45lbs which we weighed in for the calcutta.&nbsp; All fish were hitting the bally's, particularly the blue and white billybait. </p>
              <p>Better late then never, at 2:45, with lines out at 3, a bill appeared in our spread and stripped two bally's before we hooked up on our long rigger bait and our Captain boated our first White Marlin on the new boat, unfortunately he was about 60 inches, too small for the 68" min so he was released and our Captain was congratulated with a ceremonial baptism, a dockside dunk to end the day.</p>
              <p>With questionable weather for Saturday, we fought off the exhaustion and prepared to fish for Friday.</p>
              <p>Knowing that the largest Tuna on the board was only 60lbs and most of the Whites being caught were small, we went North on the hunt for bigger tuna, and fished the area inside the Toms.&nbsp; It was a slow start to the morning and we had worked both the flats and the deep with not even a knockdown, so we made the decision to run back in a little to where we had better water.</p>
              <p>During the ride we came across a lot of life and decided to get the lines wet.&nbsp; As we were deploying the baits, on the left long rigger, after huge crash on the top of the water, the 50W went screaming.&nbsp; We locked the reel up and he just kept running.&nbsp; Kevin fought him for about thirty minutes and we had him in about 50 ft of water, laying on his side, doing death circles, ready to leader and gaff him but the fish had other plans.&nbsp; He shook and turned his head and it was just enough to spit the hook, the line went slack along with our hopes.&nbsp; He was estimated at 80-100lbs.&nbsp; That's the way it goes sometimes, that's why they call it fishing and not catching.</p>
              <p>We trolled hard the rest of the day and only found some smaller tuna and one lonely Mahi at the end of the day.&nbsp; We didn't get the big one this time, but we'll sure keep trying. </p>

width="133" align="right" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000000; margin-left:5px;">Departed Manasquan Inlet @ 6:00 am in heavy fog after checking out for our single entry tournament day (if you want to fish multiple days, you must enter twice)&nbsp; We were entered in both the Mako Mania &amp; Mako Rodeo.&nbsp; This was a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; tournament as I had some of the staff &amp; friends from Ocean Beach Marine on board for their first ever shark trip (they never caught anything larger than a blue fish).&nbsp; To round out the crew, I had my father (father&rsquo;s day gift) and friend Rob (mate) on board.&nbsp; We fished the fingers about a 40 mile run from the inlet.&nbsp; We had lines in the water @ 7:30.&nbsp; Water temp peaked close at 70 degrees.&nbsp; All was quiet till 11:00 or so till we had an estimated 150 lb Mako working up our slick.&nbsp; I dropped him pitch bait and hooked up for 60 seconds and he spit the hook.&nbsp; Changed the rig and dropped him another as he came back up, took off again and had him on for about 3 min and he spit the hook on me again.&nbsp; It was quiet again till about 12:30.&nbsp; One of our mid range baits took off like a freight train.&nbsp; We were into this fish for about 30 minutes and realized it was a nice Thresher.&nbsp; We worked this fish over for 2 hrs and had him roped off &amp; shot boat side.&nbsp; It took us another hour to get him in the boat (had to shoot him again, he was still kicking) Weighed the fish in at Hoffman&rsquo;s, tipped the scales @ 286 lbs.&nbsp; We had the Thresher Calcutta for a short while then another boat came in with a 323 Thresher (still waiting to confirm the final standings).&nbsp; Considering we had an inexperienced crew on the rod, they did great at getting a large fish in the boat.&nbsp; We were greeted back at the dock around 5:30PM with many cheers and high fives, it was a blast.&nbsp; I will send some pics as soon as I get them. </p>

              <p><span class="contentLink">June 10-13, 2004</span> - 24th Annual South Jersey Shark Tournament</p>
              <p><strong>Friday:</strong>&nbsp; Started out running 22-24 knots in a stiff NE wind, @ 14 miles off, the committee boats cancelled day 1 fishing due to the conditions.&nbsp; Winds were 20-25 knots, seas were 4-6 but very tight.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Saturday:</strong>&nbsp; With much better conditions than Fri., we set a course for a 56 mile SE run.&nbsp; We found some nice clean 65.8 degree water when we arrived around 8:50 am.&nbsp; Since lines were not allowed in the water till 9:30, we scouted the area for a bit and found the temp break to 67.4 degree water.&nbsp; We set up and had our first of 5 blue shark releases around 1:00.&nbsp; We then had steady action with all blue sharks taking pitch baits @ the transom.&nbsp; At 4:20, the &ldquo;hooked up&rdquo; calls started to the committee boats since fishing commences @ 4:30.&nbsp; As we chuckled throughout the day, thinking&hellip; How could so many folks suddenly hook up within the last 15 minutes of fishing???&nbsp; Seconds later, zzzzzing there goes our rod and we are hooked up.&nbsp; We call in the hook up and are in amazement at the aerial show from our Mako.&nbsp; Within 30 minutes, we sunk the flying gaff into the fish and hit it with the bang stick&hellip;&nbsp; 2 tail ropes and he is in the boat.&nbsp; Now, we are headed to the scales.&nbsp; Although the fish was only 156 lbs, (did not qualify for the 200lb minimum weight) we had a great day.</p>
              <p><strong>Sunday: &nbsp;</strong>Conditions were fair, a little bumpy on the way out.&nbsp; We had a 46 mile run SE and took the steady 3-4 foot head sea for the entire ride.&nbsp; We were at our location @ 8:40.&nbsp; The best temp we could find after scouting around was 66.2.&nbsp; We were set up by 9:30 and had our first of 6 Mako releases @ 10:30.&nbsp; Our fish ranged from estimated 75 lbs to 180 lbs.&nbsp; We decided not to kill any of these fish as we were hoping for something larger and had no reason to kill any under fish under the 200 lb qualifying weight.&nbsp; The largest fish @ approx 180 lbs was a non-stop battle.&nbsp; With 5-6 jumps, we were in awe watching this fish work me over while harnessed in.&nbsp; It was spectacular.</p>
              <p>We ended up 5/5 on blue shark releases, 1/1 on boated Makos, and 6/7 on Mako releases.&nbsp; 5 blue sharks and 7 Makos in 2 days&hellip; We could not ask for anything more. </p>

              <p>Overall--it was a good weekend. Friday we fished old orchard and got blasted by bluefish in the am with Raoul and Dave with Mr V. No Bass. In the afternoon we found the bait in the back bay and got one nice bass in the boat while loading up on Bait for the weekend. Brian was having a blast.</p>
              <p>We also had our first man overboard drill that went very well--both Marc and the castnet are doing good.</p>
              <p>Sat we briefly tried old orchard again but all bluefish so we ran up by the Bridge and found the fleet and drifted some live baits but the bite was slow and we chased another report and headed to the rocks--still no bass.</p>
              <p>We went back to the triangle and found the same bait as the night before but no bass were eating.</p>
              <p>Sunday we wanted to see that same bait at first light to see if that was when the bass would eat and it paid off. We got about 4 bass within and hour, one on a head (Martha), and the rest on live bunker. Job well done. We trolled the area with SSSPPPOOOOOOONSSS when the bite slowed down but only one more small bass so we went up by the Bridge to set up on the chunk and finished the day trolling the spppoooonnsss toward the docks with no more bass.</p>
              <p>In retrospect-we should of hit that bait ball first thing in the morning on Sat--we had good research but ignored it early. We figured out that back in the bay--the bite would be on early in the morning and late in the evening. I also think we need to start looking more to the rivers, where the biggest bass are usually caught. For the bass tournaments I think our philosophy should be to get a bass in the boat and then hunt for the big one. Let me know what you guys think. I had a great weekend--that was my first experience snagging bunker and it is awesome.</p>
              <p>A special thanks to Brian and Sherri for their hospitality! Have a great memorial day weekend and let's get ready for some SSSSHHHHHAAAAARRRRKKKKKKSS!</p>

              <p>Put the boat in the water at Bree Zee Lee and tied up at SJ Marina around 7:00pm on Friday night. </p>
              <p>Headed out on Sat. around 6:00am.&nbsp; Started up at Ship John, went to Artificial Reef # 1, then to EP Tower area, then to 20 ft slough and finished at the 60ft slough.&nbsp; Nothing to show for it.&nbsp; Bay was really rough with steady 4-5 foot seas.&nbsp; Wind was NE 20-25 knots, gusting to 40. </p>
              <p>Sun was a much nicer weather day.&nbsp; Headed out the canal and ran towards the 8a, 8b area.&nbsp; Drifted Herring for an hour with no luck.&nbsp; Moved up the bay to the Brown Shoal area.&nbsp; Picked 2 fish there, 1 on herring, one on clam.&nbsp; Moved to a spot between the bananna peel and the 60ft slough, no luck.&nbsp; Finished up at the Pin Top with no other fish.&nbsp; Weighed in our fish, both were 16 lbs.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>We caught one fish on live herring and the other on fresh clam.&nbsp; We also chunked bunker for hours and could not keep the dogfish off the lines.&nbsp; We finished 9th out of 25 boats for the event. </p>

Sat. we caught acouple of fish at the Miah Maul and a couple more at the 20 ft slough. We were about 4 for 6 with the largest fish about 30 lbs. All the fish were taken on the outgoing tide on fresh chunks of bunker. Two early on the turn and then 2 later closer to the end of the tide run.</p>
              <p>Sun. the guys were 1 for 2 out by the Miah Maul on chunks on the outgoing-- a little slower but productive weekend overall. </p>
